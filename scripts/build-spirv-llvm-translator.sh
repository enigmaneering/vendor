# per-platform split (darwin/linux shared, win/wasm static) — every
# platform now produces a static archive that libmental merges into one
# self-contained dylib on its side.  The dyld-symbol-leak hazard the old
# shared-lib visibility whitelist was guarding against (two LLVMs in one
# process) is structurally eliminated: the final dylib has exactly one
# LLVM.  Symbol visibility for the final dylib is controlled by its own
# exports list (cmake/mental-llvm-exports.txt).
